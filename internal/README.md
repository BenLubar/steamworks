The files in the `include` and `lib` subfolders are extracted from the [SteamWorks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/steamworks_sdk.zip).

The `.a` and `.def` files in the `lib/windows` subfolder are generated with `reimp`.

The current version in this package is v1.42.

To (re)generate the `*_string.go` and `api.gen.*` files, run `go generate`.
