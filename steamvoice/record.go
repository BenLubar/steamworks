// Reader is a stream of captured audio data from the microphone buffer.
//
// The compressed data can be transmitted by your application and decoded back
// into raw audio data using DecompressVoice on the other side. The compressed
// data provided is in an arbitrary format and is not meant to be played
// directly.
//
// This should be read from once per frame, and at worst no more than four
// times a second to keep the microphone input delay as low as possible.
// Reading any less frequently may result in gaps in the returned stream.
//
// It is recommended that you pass in an 8 kilobytes or larger destination
// buffer for compressed audio. Static buffers are recommended for performance
// reasons. However, if you would like to allocate precisely the right amount
// of space for a buffer before each call you may use Reader.Available() to find
// out how much data is available to be read.
