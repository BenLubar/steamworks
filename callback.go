//   your application from the executable or debugger directly then you must
//   have a steam_appid.txt in your game directory next to the executable, with
//   your app ID in it and nothing else. Steam will look for this file in the
//   current working directory. If you are running your executable from a
//   different directory you may need to relocate the steam_appid.txt file.
// - Your application is not running under the same OS user context as the
//   Steam client, such as a different user or administration access level.
// - Ensure that you own a license for the App ID on the currently active Steam
//   account. Your game must show up in your Steam library.
// - Your App ID is not completely set up, i.e. in Release State: Unavailable,
//   or it's missing default packages.
